# Swarm-Contrastive Decomposition üß†

## Overview üìù
Welcome to the Swarm-Contrastive Decomposition project! This repository contains the code of our research paper on decomposition of Neurophysiological Time Series signals. The primary goal of this project is to provide an open-source implementation for fostering further research in this area.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software and libraries installed:
- Python 3.10 üêç
- NumPy üì¶
- PyTorch üî•

### Steps
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/AgneGris/swarm-contrastive-decomposition
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd swarm-contrastive-decomposition
    ```
3. Create the conda environment from the `decomposition.yml` file:
    ```sh
    conda env create -f decomposition.yml
    ```
4. Activate the environment:
    ```sh
    conda activate decomposition
    ```

## How to use this repository üöÄ
1. **Upload Your Input Data:**
   - Place your input data files in the `data/input` folder.

2. **Modify Data Loading:**
   - Depending on your data structure, you may need to adjust the data loading logic in `main.py` (lines 41-53).

3. **Configure the Parameters:**
   - Customize the configuration settings in `main.py` according to your needs:
     - **`device`**: Set to `"cuda"` for GPU or `"cpu"` for CPU.
     - **`acceptance_silhouette`**: Define the acceptance threshold for source quality.
     - **`extension_factor`**: This factor typically equals `1000 / number of channels`. A higher value may improve results.
     - **`low_pass_cutoff`**: Define the cutoff frequency for the low-pass filter.
     - **`high_pass_cutoff`**: Define the cutoff frequency for the high-pass filter.
     - **`start_time`**: Set the start time for signal trimming. Use `0` to include the entire signal from the beginning.
     - **`end_time`**: Set the end time for signal trimming. Use `-1` to include the entire signal until the end.
     - **`max_iterations`**: Specify the maximum number of iterations for the decomposition process.
     - **`sampling_frequency`**: Indicate the sampling frequency of your signal.
     - **`peel_off_window_size`**: Define the size of the window (in ms) for the spike-triggered average of the source.
     - **`output_final_source_plot`**: Set to `True` to generate a plot of the final source, or `False` to skip plotting.
     - **`use_coeff_var_fitness`**: Set to `True` if consistent activity is expected in discharge times (recommended for most EMGs); set to `False` for other types of data (e.g., intracortical).
     - **`remove_bad_fr`**: Set to `True` to filter out sources with firing rates below 2 Hz or above 100 Hz. You can adjust these thresholds in `models\scd.py` if needed.
   - Other configuration parameters are found in `config\structures`. 

4. **Run the Decomposition:**
   - Once your data is properly loaded and configured, run the following command to start the decomposition process:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ``` 
   - Once the decomposition process has terminated, the output data will be saved in the `data/output` folder.
